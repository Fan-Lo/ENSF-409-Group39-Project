## Problem Definition
Our client requested an application that allows for efficient generation of food hampers 
based on specificed inventory availability and family nutrional needs. The program should
allow user interaction using a graphical user interface and access to an mySQL database 
for information regarding food availability and clinet needs. An ideal hamper generated by the application should ensure a balanced diet with sufficient caloric content with minimal waste.
